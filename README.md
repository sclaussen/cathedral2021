# Background

Cathedral Peak is one of the most prominent peaks near Tuolumne
Meadows in the portion of Yosemite that's north of Yosemite Valley.
John Muir made the first ascent of Cathedral Peak in 1869 by
scampering up the 4th class backside in boots.  The base of the peak
is around 10,200ft and it tops out at around 10,900ft (netting 700ft
of great climbing on white granite with knobs sprinkled everywhere).
The view from the top is unsurpassed due to Cathedral's central
location in Yosemite.  The approach begins in Tuolumne Meadows at
8600ft and takes about 2 hours.

Cathederal is well known among climbers due to its moderately rated
routes and beautiful white knobby granite.  The climbs go up the
southwest face and there are three "primary" variations, A, B, and C,
from left to right (although there are numerous variations in
between).  If climbed with a typical 60m rope (~185 feet), Cathedral
can be completed in 5 pitches.  The climbing is relatively sustained
and diverse and increases in difficulty and verticality as you ascend.

There are a couple notable features in the climb.  The first is the
chimney.  The A, B, and C route variations all converge at the
beginning of the fourth pitch at the chimney which frequentl becomes a
major choke point of the climb serializing climbing teams.  The summit
blocks are another notable feature.  The last pitch has a nice 5.6
crack at the top with a false summit, followed by a (really is this
the move?!) short down climb and a step across a very exposed gully,
and then John Muir's ~20 foot 4th class scramble up onto two small
summit blocks.  Last but not least, the descent down the backside of
Cathedral is somewhat notorious (eg the death ledges).

If Cathedral is the main course, Eichorn's Pinnacle is the desert.
Eichorn is one of the most spectacular features in Tuolumne, named
after Jules Eichorn who was part of the first ascent party in 1931
(and another prominent early Yosemite climber).  It can be climbed on
its own right from its base, but after climbing Cathedral, it's only
about a 10 minute scramble over to Eichorn where there's a stellar,
airy, exposed, single pitch waiting.



# Strategy

Here's a summary of our strategy:
- Climb on Friday to avoid the crowds
- Use a single 80m (8.5mm) rope, Jon leads, Caden ties in 30ft above me
- Travel light (cams double .3 to 2 with a single 3)
- Simulclimb if required the easier/lower pitches
- Finish early, and then knock out Eichorn's pinnacle
- Arrive back before dark!



# Approach

**July 16th, 2021**: Zeenat, Caden, and I met Jon at 9:30am at the
Cathedral Lakes trailhead.  We sorted our gear, tossed on our
harnesses and climbing packs, and began the hike in.  It was a clear,
picturesque, and beautiful high sierra day, that never had a cloud in
the sky.  It took us 2hrs 15mins to cover the 27 miles to get to the
base of the climb, and another 30 minutes or so to get ready to climb.



# Pitch 1 of 3

Jon began the first pitch at around 12:30, it was warm at the base, so
Caden and I both started with a single layer.  There was a party on
the A route, and several above, so Jon picked a line between the A and
B variations.  Caden and I began climbing around 10 minutes later, and
were simulclimbing with Jon (Jon continued to leading as Caden and I
followed).  Jon built a belay station on the 5.4 dihedral just above
the top of the second pitches for the A, B, and C routes (giving us a
really long initial pitch of around ~300ft).

Caden quotes from pitch 1 while climbing:
- On learning what it's like to follow Jon: "There's no protection
  whatsoever."
- While waiting for Jon to build the anchor: "Awesome view I love it."
  and later "I love the view."
- Jon: "How do you like it so far?"  Caden: "I really like it, the
  view's super nice."
- "These Tuolumne knobs are littered all over."



# Pitch 2 of 3

There were around 5 parties of 2 at the chimney choke point, so Jon
suggested we take the variation that goes up to the left of the
chimney to try and pass the parties so we'd still have a chance to get
Eichorn in before dark.  Although the variation was a bit stiffer we
opted for that option.  When Caden followed Jon's awesome lead, as the
climbing difficulty increased, Caden locked in and his climbing
technique increased, and he cruised through the two notivceabe crux
sections with ease.  The belay station was towards the far left of the
southwest face and was relatively exposed.  For the most part, Caden
used a hanging belay technique as Jon led the 3rd pitch.  Caden was up
around 500 feet now and was on cloud 9, loving the view, feeling
confident that he was going to be able to finish the route, etc.

Note: We added a layer here for Caden, changed his GoPro battery,
drank a lot of water, but I made a mistake by not getting any carbs
into his system.



# Pitch 3 of 3

Although we'd passed several parties, there were still a couple above
us by the time Jon began the 3rd pitch and he passed them on his lead.
This top section is characterized by a lot of different shorter
sections of varied climbing.  In one section Jon had taken the 5.9
finger crack variation.  When Caden got there, he made the attempt but
the rope was pulling him to the left, so he got a bit frustrated, and
eventually we bailed on that variation and he took the middle 5.6
bulge and I took the even easier move left of that.  Above that, all
that was left was the 5.6 crack to the false summit.  We had to wait
in the crack behind a girl who took about 10 minutes to make the very
last move at the top of the crack where it gets a bit wide.  She and
her partner had begun the route at 7:30am!  Caden struggled in the
same spot briefly but pushed through and disappeared over the false
summit.



# Topping Out

Jon had built the belay station at the very base of the summit blocks
so I took the super short lead up the summit blocks (unnecessarily
placing one cam), built a belay station, and belayed Caden up (Jon
unroped and free solo'ed up to join us).  We had topped out after only
2:45 minutes of climbing.  Zeenat had hiked up the descent trail and
was in a position on the backside of Cathedral enabling us to see her
and vice versa.

Caden's first words upon reaching the summit block were "I'm happy and
I'm tired, there's Eichorn."  We'd been looking and discussing Eichorn
for a couple years, so although he was exhausted his first thought
upon summiting Cathedral was to refocus on his next goal - Eichorn.



# Traverse to Eichorn

After topping out, I lowered Caden from the summit block, Jon and I
down solo'ed, and we transitioned quickly off the route to the
backside of Cathedral.

There, we took a short break, Jon managed the rope, and I got Caden to
eat a bit and drink, but it was challenging, it was clear that he was
either dehydrated, bonked, had altitude sickness, or a combination of
all the above.  Normally we would have simply scampered across the
ledges to Eichorn, but due to his condition, we did a full 80m rap
down to a safer set of ledges and from there I short toped Caden to me
and we scrambled carefully over to the base of Eichorn's Pinnacle
where Jon had established an anchor for our last pitch of the day.



# Eichorn's Pinnacle

Now that we'd sat on Cathedral's summit block, this became the money
pitch, and it was a new one for both Caden and I.  In my opinion it
was the most complex and interesting pitch of the day.  If you turn a
C around backwards, and start at the bottom of the C, traverse right,
move up, then traverse left, that's the general path that the pitch
takes.

The first portion is characterized by a traverse where you are
wrapping your way around the pinnacle and you even down climb a bit
and are immediately very exposed with several hundred feet of
nothingness below you.  When I climbed this traverse I inadvertently
lost my balance at one point, and very nearly fell.

The crux of the route is right when the initial traverse completes and
the vertical ascent begins.  Jon and I used a couple high left holds
to get through this crux.  Caden said he found a little nob to his
right and did a pull to get up to it and a push on it to get up
farther to a much better hold beyond the crux.  This vertical section
is really nice and varied.

At the top where you begin the traverse back towards the climbers
left, there are these huge dihedrals.  Think two columns, about a body
width apart, with the option of going to the left of the left column,
or the right of the right column, or right up between the two columns.
I think people tend to go left (the route topo is marked with "exposed
move left").  Caden and I'd watched a couple videos preparing and he'd
seen the spot to go left so he didn't struggle with the offwidth in
the middle.  Unfortunately, Jon had gone right!  I waited at the base
for several minutes as Jon explained to Caden how to get back on route
and they worked it out.  I too was surprised when I got to this
section.  The right side of the right column was the opposite side of
the pinnacle from where we'd began the vertical ascent, and its
exposure is even more extreme, basically vertical, for a long ways,
with spectactular views.

At the summit it was clear Caden was exhausted so we took a couple
photos and quickly descended.  I rappelled first, followed by Caden,
then Jon.  I then short roped with Caden and we made our way back
across the ledges and after about 20 minutes we got to the other side
where mom was waiting.  We switched shoes, fueled up, and began our
hike back.



# Summary

Time:
- 9:30am - parked, geared up, 2 hour 15 minute approach (very slow pace)
- 12:30pm - started climbing
- 3:15pm - cathedral summit (2 hour 45 minutes of climbing)
- 5:30pm - eichorn summit
- 6:30pm - begin return hike starting at the backside of cathedral
- 8:30pm - Returned to the trailhead (11 hours car to car)

Reminders from this climb:
- Wearing in our harnesses worked out well
- We needed all the water we took (3L for Caden and I plus a couple liters on the approach)
- The more high altitude acclimation we can do prior, the better (Caden suffered from some altitude sickness during the adventure)
